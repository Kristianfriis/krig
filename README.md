# krig
A personal project to build the cardgame Krig(War) in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In short, a deck of cards is shuffled and each player is given 26 cards, jokers is not included. 
After that each person takes the first card in their deck abd the one with the highest value gets the two cards and puts
them in his discard pile.

If it is the same value it is krig(war) time, each player takes the first 3 cards and the third card√∏s value determine the winner. 

When one of the players have no cards left in his deck, both players shuffle their discard pile and the game resumes until one player
have got all the 52 cards. 

It is a project to use:
 - Arrays
 - Array manipulating
 - loops
 - if/else/switch
 - dynamically updating content
 - in the future the use of a database to hold the cards data
 - database to hold number of wins, so a login will be needed. 
 - would really like to include multiplayer.
